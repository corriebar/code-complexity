# Code Complexity

In the notebook [Code Complexity](Code_Complexity.ipynb) you can find an example flow on how to use the different [complexity metrics](code/complexity_metrics.py).

To run the notebook, you might have to setup a Google Sheet [service account](https://docs.gspread.org/en/v5.7.1/oauth2.html#authentication) for the authentication.
To install the necessary python packages, run the following command in the root directory of the repository:
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The slides for the talk can be found here.
